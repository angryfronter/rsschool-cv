#### **About me**


I started doing front-end development at the beginning of my third year at university. We had a subject related to front-end development. Since I am a creative person (I graduated from an art school), I tried it and really liked it. Over time, I learned more and more and started creating my first websites.


Recently, I had the opportunity to work as a designer at the Belarusian company Decoled. I created layouts for a catalog for 3 months. That's where I started doing website design in Figma. My goal is to create quality and interesting products. I want to learn React and improve my knowledge of JavaScript and its frameworks even further.
